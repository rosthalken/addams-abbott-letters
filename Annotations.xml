                <persName>Edith Abbott</persName>
                <note>Edith Abbott was born on September 26, 1876 in Grand Island, Nebraska, into a politically and socially active Nebraskan family. After receiving a degree at the University of Nebraska, Edith attended the University of Chicago on a fellowship to study political economy. In 1905, she obtained her doctoral degree and spent multiple years at the University College London studying social economics and welfare. She returned to the United States to continue a successful career of teaching and researching social welfare alongside Grace Abbott, Sophonisba Breckinridge, and other women at Jane Addams’ Hull House. Abbott’s work focused on social statistics as a methodology to look critically at women’s rights, child labor, immigration, and public welfare. She was promoted to Dean of the University of Chicago’s School of Social Service Administration in 1924, and held that position until retiring in 1942. </note>

                    <note>Grace Abbott, sister of Edith Abbott, was born to an influential family in Grand Island, Nebraska on November 17, 1878. After several years of teaching high school in Grand Island and receiving a degree at the University of Nebraska, Grace moved to Chicago to join her sister at Jane Addams’ Hull House. She became increasingly involved in social reform regarding immigrant rights, child labor laws, and women’s rights. In 1917, Abbott moved to Washington D.C. where she quickly became the director of the Child Labor Division of the Children’s Bureau in 1917. She led the Bureau until her health began to fail and she returned to Chicago to live with Edith in 1934. Though undergoing continued poor health, Grace continued her involvement in the Social Security Administration until her death in 1939.</note>

                    <note>Born on October 13, 1862 in Hollansburg, Ohio, John Rogers Commons is best known as the first economist committed to advocating the U.S. labor through the research, movement, and legislative activity. After graduating Oberlin College in 1888, he continued his studies at Johns Hopkins University for two years. In 1895, Commons began teaching at Syracuse University from which he was fired four years later as he was considered radical by the school. In 1904, he was appointed as a professor at the University of Wisconsin to teach labor economics until his retirement in 1933. He made many contributions to Wisconsin as well as the federal government, notably in the outline of legislation in Wisconsin for labor unions, unemployment insurance, minimum wage and in the design of the Social Security Act of 1935. His acclaimed publications include Documentary History of American Industrial Society and History of Labor in the United States. Commons died on May 11, 1945. </note>
